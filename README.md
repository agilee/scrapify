## ScrApify

ScrApify is a library to build APIs by scraping static sites and use data as models or JSON APIs

### Installation

```
$ gem install scrapify
```

### Usage

Define html url and declare attributes using xpath or css selectors.
Scrapify classes must have a key attribute defined.

```
class Pizza
  include Scrapify::Base
  html "http://www.dominos.co.in/menuDetails_ajx.php?catgId=1"

  attribute :name, css: ".menu_lft li a"
  attribute :image_url, xpath: "//li//input//@value"

  key :name
end
```

Now you can use finder methods to extract data from a static site

```
> Pizza.all

> pizza = Pizza.find('mushroom')
> pizza.name
> pizza.image_url

> Pizza.first
> Pizza.last

> Pizza.count
```

### JSON API (Rack application example)

Scrapify comes with a Rack application called Jsonify which can expose scraped models as JSON.
Rack application example is [here](https://github.com/sathish316/jsonify_rack_example)

In your Rack application map the routes you want to expose using Rack::Builder#map

```
  map '/pizzas' do
    run Jsonify.new('/pizzas', ::Pizza)
  end
```

This will expose two urls index and show which return JSON:

* /pizzas
* /pizzas/:id

Jsonify currently has a limitation where the URLs /pizzas.json and /pizzas/1.json cannot be matched by the same map entry in Rack routes
